Asset Management App

Build process:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

To start build docker file

```shell
dodocker compose build
```

then

```shell
dodocker compose up
```

Part of the application was not covered by tests because flow will be the same. It wouldn't include anything new to the
solution.

New integration and Unit Test would be following the same testing pattern.
